# Dashboard
It is a frontend based project designed and developed using the React.js. The whole design is taken from the [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/14281783-fintech-dashboard-user-interface) and try to design it pixel perfect UI and also add some sort of animation for better looks. It is not compatible with all device size. It is my first try to work out with the dashboard. Not much know about how dashboard looks in small devices.

The application is deploy to Netlify. You can check it out by clicking [here](https://nervous-goldwasser-ef7a7f.netlify.app/).
